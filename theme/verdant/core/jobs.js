/* verdant/core/jobs.js -- deferred section builds run in time-budgeted slices
   Part of Verdant, a Spotify-style theme for foobar2000. Loaded by main.js;
   every module shares one global scope, so load order is set there. */

/* ---- deferred section builds -------------------------------------------------------------
   The panel has one thread, so a section that builds its data inline blocks the very paint that
   should be showing a loading state -- and blocks input with it. Instead a section reports "not
   ready", paints a skeleton, and its build runs as a sequence of short steps on timer ticks, so
   the message loop keeps processing clicks and scrolls in between.
   The units we cannot split are a single EvalWithMetadbs and Array.sort; everything else is
   sliced around them. ready() reads the real data, so any invalidate*() re-arms this for free. */
/* Steps run in time-budgeted slices, not one per tick. A timer on Windows lands ~15ms out, so
   one-step-per-tick turned an eleven-step build that used to take 20ms into ~165ms -- slower than
   the thing it was smoothing, and long enough to flash a skeleton. Instead a slice keeps running
   steps until it has used its budget, and the FIRST slice runs synchronously: anything that fits
   in a frame finishes inline and never shows a loading state at all. */
